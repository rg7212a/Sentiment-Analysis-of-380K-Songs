0,ego-remix,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"Oh baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase
Some women were made but me, myself
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you? You feel me
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a site to see, kind of something like me
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he love my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano"
1,then-tell-me,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"playin' everything so easy,
it's like you seem so sure.
still your ways, you dont see
i'm not sure if they're for me.
then things come right along our way, though we didn't truly ask.
it seems as if they're gonna linger
with every delight they bring,
just like what you have truly seemed.
i'm trying to think of what you really want to say,
even through my darkest day.
you might want to leave me,
feeling strange about you
like you're gonna let me know,
when words then slipped out of you.
when words dont come so easy to say
you just leave me feeling, come what may
though i want things coming from your way.
i say to you, you bore me all the time
when you seem to hold back all in you,
all that you want to let me know.
why dont you have the courage?
speak up and i'll listen,
if you truly want me to know, then tell me.
is there something wrong with you
and you seem fastened there.
it sounds as if there'll be a melody
if things in you are let out
and then i will feel alright.
when you sleep, do you feel the same,
exactly as i do?
i really want to hear things from you,
though i've felt something new
eversince you acted that way.
if i go,
would you still mind telling me?
if i stay,
you seem to let the days go by.
if you truly want to let me know,
then tell me."
2,honesty,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"If you search
For tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love
You need to live
But if you look
For truthfulness
You might just
As well be blind
It always seems to be
So hard to give
Chorus:
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly
What I need from you
I can always
Find someone
To say
They sympathize
If I wear my heart
Out on my sleeve
But I don't want
Some pretty face
To tell me
Pretty lies
All I want
Is someone
To believe
(Chorus)
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know
When I'm deep
Inside of me
Don't be
Too concerned
I won't ask
For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want
Sincerity
Tell me where else
Can I turn
When
You're the one
That I depend upon
(Chorus)"
3,you-are-my-rock,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Verse 1:]
If I wrote a book about where we stand
Then the title of my book would be ""Life with Superman""
That's how you make me feel I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same I see it everyday
In all the things you do
In all the things you say
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need

I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I
[Verse 2:]
If I were to try to count the ways
You make me smile
I'd run out of fingers
Before I run out of timeless things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my lovin strong
Make me wanna try my best
To give you what you want and what you need
Give you my whole heart, not just a little piece
More than a minimum,
I'm talking everything
More than a single wish,
I'm talking every dream
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you
[Bridge:]
If there's options I don't want them
They're not worth my time
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you I like us just fine
You're a rock in the sand
You're a smile in a cry
You're my joy through the pain
You're the truth through the lies
No matter what I do I know that I can count on you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night

Church bells ringing
I heard
A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring
Oooh, oh
I saw them
Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
I heard
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending
Ooh
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man

Hoping that I'll hear you.
Tell me ""No"" and I'll fade away,
But this is lovin that I won't waste

I got style and I got ass

Keep you happy with the nasty things I do

Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?

I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
With eyes lead to a pot of gold
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?

I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control
Nothing injured nothing gained
New horizon ready to play
with every breath you take it away
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend

But after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand
That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me

I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart breaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control
[Chorus]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do it's a catch 22
cause the cure is found in you I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
[Verse 2]
You aint right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait I'm alive
But how long will it last
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down
[Chorus]
Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

It's just not my body (No)
It's my mind, you don't know
How many times I told myself
This cant do (cant do)
And that I don't need you (No I don't need you)(no)
It's so unfair(fair) that I find myself right back in your care(care)
And what's good is that when you're not always there (there there)
You're no good for my health (my heath)
You're just like poison (whoa whoa whoa) (repeat)

You're just like poison

I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I cant lie
Baby Kiss me one more time
you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it to
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time

Beyonce
IAM
Welcome
Welcome
Hey
Ohhhh
Beyonc - Chorus:
Welcome to a place
Where people lie to your face
Just to get it done.
Welcome to the human race
Where if you ain't got money, then you'll pay in pain
Welcome to this world of ours
And if you had the chance would you come back again ?
Cause now you're here there ain't no turning back,
You got tears in your eyes
And the monkey on your back (?)*
Akhenaton - Verse 1:
Bienvenue l o l'fort tue le faible, o la faim tue de fait
O la socit t'congratule, et t'accepte une fois la fortune faite,
O les dettes cumulent, o l'crdit accule, des tas d'foyers,
O les hommes en perte d'idaux, jurent qu'par les putes dvoyes en vido,
Chaque soir c'est la fte, les salons cossus attirent les fesses,
Sur les gros cads, qui arrosent les guridons de pure cocane,
Ici, les gosses rvent d't'Pirs, beaucoup partent et peu qui restent,
Nombreux sont ceux qui ds 13 ans connaissent leur premire ivresse,
Bienvenue l o l'air pollu, par les pots d'chappement dclenchent
Allergies en cascade, et taux record d'O3 dans les bronches,
Douleurs dans les hanches, rien plus d'dangereux qu'la faune humaine
Quand ils explosent un fourgon Brinks sans peine au Tri-Nitro-Tolune,
Les vices connus gnent la machine de l'Etat, les cabinets changent
Laissent la merde en tat, peu passent les menottes en mtal, on en est l
Ici 300 blinds font c'qui veulent, font comme s'ils vivent seuls
Ramnent tout leur p'tite gueule, quand mille meurent fauchs dans l'viseur
Bienvenue, aprs le 11 septembre on voque une aut'voie
Au silence : dis au revoir, l'enculeur d'aut'fois, dit baiser le monde haute voix
O les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les m'mes de Bangkok
Pourquoi donc mettre part ces connards en taule
Ici on croit moins en Dieu qu'aux fant'mes, un hymne sanguinaire
On entonne, partout on sent la peur d'un peuple pass au pantone
L'hiver mange l't, et l'printemps parfois tue l'automne,
Crie Plus fort, les grands de c'monde, ont gar quelque part leur sonotone
Bienvenue, mes p'tits anges
Car voici c'monde
Beyonc - Chorus:
Welcome to a place

We all have a purpose in this world
We have to believe that we belong
Can't forget where we came from
We came from love.
Shurik'n - Verse 2:
Bienvenue dans c'truc entre enfer et paradis tant't l'un tant't l'autre.
Ange et dmon s'y disputent le parvis pour enjeu ceux qui s'y vautrent.
O l'on s'occupe de l'horreur seulement quand elle frappe nos portes.
O la rumeur tue sournoisement, vicieux coup de surin dans l'aorte.
O tu bouffes de la merde chaque jour et on te le dit qu'20 ans aprs.
Parce qu'en fait ils s'en tapent de c' qu'on pense on l'sait mais ils le diront jamais.
O on est trop con pour voir qu'un mec est bon bien avant qu'il meure
Puis on se vante de le connatre achetant ses tableaux visitant sa demeure
Bienvenue dans c'monde o on se dit tous gaux blague part l
L'caniveau l haut c'est les bureaux mais le mieux c'est au milieu
O on se sait si fragile qu'on prvoit les pices d'rechange
D'ici peu de temps on s'achtera des jambes en famille le dimanche
O tout le monde ne mange pas sa faim lieu de conflit sans fin
Crer dans le fond pour qu'un seul parvienne ses fins
La misre comme moyen o le suppos mort esclavage svit encore en divers lieux
Tu vois ! Il y a toujours des grains de poussire vaniteux qui s'prennent pour des dieux
Bienvenue pas Gattaca mais presque o seul l'lu vite la presse
On parque le reste en attendant que vieillesse se manifeste,
O on parle prslection, d'amlioration, transformation
Gntique, c'est pas magnifique une armada de super soldats de plomb
O on s'tue pour un bifteck ou un bifton
O on entend le mensonge aveugle, on voit pas l'illusion, envole la laine du mouton
Je t'annonce le sombre, parce que le clair, j'prfrerais qu'tu le dcouvre,
Allez petit ! Lance toi t'inquite fonce ! Moi, j'te couvre

Cause I aint good enough

And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything

Doing what we like to do... our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during ""Sex and the City""
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and be

With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin

With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that

Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens

And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life

Realize all my blessings

Feel, To breathe, To love you

Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become, yeah
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make, you're there for me
You cure my disappointments
And you heal my pain
You understood my biz and you protected me
I treasure every year in place a comemory
And that's why, I want my unborn son
To be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin' me

When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend

I still remember, I called you cryin'
'Cuz of my tattoo, coulda said, ""Beyonce, I told ya so""
Instead you said you'd get one too

Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do, ohh

No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
I know I'm lucky, know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming, Lord why did you pick me?
Can't stop my tears from falling, I love you so much daddy

Who has come here from Battle Creek.
As he walks with his Pepsi can,
He is bumped by the strangest man.
He feels no wish as he sees it roll,
Down the street to an open hole.
The taste sensation he loves so well,
Now is gone, and he starts to yell.
His Pepsi fell, he shows his lust (the joy of life)
The joy of life he needs it anyhow (the joy of life, the joy of taste)
He makes the sound of a tender bear (the joy of Pepsi)
As the crowd around him starts to swell.
Sir, a Pepsi please (the joy of life)
And they pack a Pepsi onto Zeke,
The Pepsi's found, the people cheer (the taste of Pepsi)
For the joy of Pepsi now is here!

All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away
[Pre-Hook: BeyoncÃ©]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you

Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup....

From 8 until late, I think 'bout you
You own my nights I don't know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep

And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you
I been about you and I'm still about you but
We ain't finished talking
I told you you don't need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking
Cuz they don't wanna see you happier than them and girl you swear they all
Your friends and there's been a problem
You the one they hate, just come with daddy
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back
And you tell me that you're done with that
And I believe it's true as long as you know who you belong to

From when your hands are in mine

And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears

And when I'm standing in this mirror

We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls
""You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man""
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
[Verse 2: BeyoncÃ©]
We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, walking in my l'assemblage
I'm grubbing on it, gru-gru-grubbing, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, keep my brain right
I'm on the brown, yeah, gangster wife
New sheets, he sweat it out, like wash rags, he wet it out
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway, then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz serving all of this, swerv, surfing all of this good, good

If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house tryna back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that third, wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, Uh
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights, you gon' need G3

97,after-all-is-said-and-done,2006,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"Here I am looking in the mirror
An open face, the pain erased
Now the sky is clearer, I can see the sun
Now that all is, all is said and done, oh
There you are always strong when I need you
You let me give and now I live
Fearless and protected with the one I will love
After all is, all is said and done
I once believed that hearts were made to bleed
(Inside I once believed that hearts were made to bleed, oh baby)
But now I'm not afraid to say
I need you, I need you so stay with me
These precious hours
(Precious, yeah)
Greet each dawn in open arms
And dream, into tomorrow
Where there's only love
After all is, all is said and done
(Yeah baby)
Oh baby
(Inside I once believed, that hearts were meant to bleed)
(I'll never)
I'll never be afraid to say
I need you, I need you, so here
So here we are in the still of this moment
Fear is gone, hope lives on
We found our happy ending
For there's only love
(Only love)
And this sweet, sweet love
After all is, all is said and done

You give me cavities
I get a stomach ache
If I can't be with you
At night I fall asleep
And I don't want to wake up
'Cause you are in my dreams
A heavenly creation
In the body that
I only want to share with you
Hey

Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Baby, we will never finish
To be continued
Separation can't change
The love I feel for you
I'm gonna definitely be affectionate
Snuggle up tonight--let's get real intimate
'Cause only you can satisfy my appetite
'Cause when it comes to love
You get me get so excited
When I taste your lips
My body melts in bliss every time

You are my (you are my)
Universe (universe)
Everything I want and
Everything I need and
Everything worth waiting for
For better or for worse
Constant craving
Your love enslaves me, oh

But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
Tell me how should I feel when I know what I know
And my female intuition tellin' me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations what you mean you gon' choke
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spendin' your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

Won't you ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Tell me how should I feel when you made me belong
And the thought of you just touchin' her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on
He's so arrogant and bold
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma 'cause

She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
Ooh, how can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you
Ooh, why would you risk it babe
Is that the price that I pay, ooh
But this is my show, and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things
